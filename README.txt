Welcome to my program!

This program can simplify an object by combining polygons that are within a specified dihedral angle range.

To begin, you will be prompted for three inputs.

The first being the input path of the .obj model you wish to simplify, for example C:\Users\yourname\models\model.obj 

Secondly, you will be asked for the output path of the object, this must be an empty obj file (or one you are fine with being overwritten), the example in the OutputFile folder can be used if needed.

Lastly, you will be asked the degree threshold in which you wish the object to be simplified, allowed values go from 0-80, the higher the number, the more and object will be simplified.

Please note that this program is not perfect, some models may error or show mistakes.

Email wwd22rnu@uea.ac.uk if you have any more questions.


The code developed by me resides in the "Reconstructor" files.

Enjoy!
